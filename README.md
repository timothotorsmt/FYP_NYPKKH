**Respository rules to follow**

2. Only show main branch to client (exceptions r ok)
3. Make sure all code is bug free before merging
4. Follow naming conventions pls (see below)
5. Name your commits properly (so future group wont kill you)
6. Report all issues to issue tracker and use proper labels

**Branch Conventions**

Branch should be named as follows: _category/name/reference/description_
<br>Categories: **feature** (for adding/removing/polishing/refactoring features), **bugfix**, **test**
<br>Name: Ur name (optional LMAO)
<br>Reference: The issue you are working on at the moment (for bug fixes and polishes)
<br>Description: Rough description of branch

Example: _bugfix/issue42/replacing-old-assets_

**Commit Conventions**
<br>Name your commits properly.
