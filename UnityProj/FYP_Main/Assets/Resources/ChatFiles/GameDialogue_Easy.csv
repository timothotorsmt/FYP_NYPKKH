,#RPE4,1,PETER,1,I THOUGHT U SAID YOUR SHIFT WAS GOOD,,,,
,#NOTHING,1,ALICE,0,Hmm... I don't think there's anything for me to do here...,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Closed Roller Clamp,#OCCLRA,1,PETER,1,Oh no! The BBraun infusion pump is emitting an error. Let's go and resolve it :D,,,,
,#OCCLRA,2,PETER,1,To fix the alarm// it is good to check the error message shown on the BBraun Infusion pump.,,,,
,#OCCLRA,3,PETER,1,Additionally// remember to mute the alarm// as it can cause distress to the patient.,,,,
,#OCCLRB,1,PETER,1,When the infusion pump shows this error message// it usually means that the roller clamp is closed. Let's go fix that now.,,,,
,#OCCLRB,2,PETER,1,Click on the back button and find the roller clamp.,,,,
,#OCCLRC,1,PETER,1,Good job! Now that the issue is resolved// lets go back and restart the pump.,,,,
Occluision Minigame Dialogue - Pressure high,#OCCLGA,1,PETER,1,When the infusion pump shows this error message// it usually means that something is blocking the flow of the infusion tube.,,,,
,#OCCLGA,2,PETER,1,There are many reasons why this could be happening// such as a kink in the line// wrong 3 way tap configuration// phlebitis// or a clamped t-connnector.,,,,
,#OCCLGA,3,PETER,1,Let's go and check all of them to find the source of the issue.,,,,
,#OCCLGB,1,PETER,1,Yay! We resolved the issue! However// we should still see if there are any other issues.,,,,
,#OCCLGC,1,PETER,1,The alarm is very annoying// can you please deal with it? I'm trying to sleep here!,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Kinked lines,#OCCLKA,1,PETER,1,It seems the line is kinked// which is causing a pressure buildup. Let's smoothen this line out to resolve this issue.,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - T Connector,#OCCLTA,1,PETER,1,It seems that the T-connector is currently clamped// which is causing a pressure build up. Let's unclamp this to resolve the issue.,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - 3Way Tap,#OCCL3A,1,PETER,1,It seems that the threeway tap is currently not in the current position// which is causing a pressure buildup. Let's turn this to resolve the issue.,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Phlebitis,#OCCLPA,1,ALICE,0,It seems that the skin is very red and swollen. I should clamp the t-connector and tell a senior nurse.,,,,
,#OCCLPB,1,PETER,1,Good call! The skin is very red and swollen. Let's stop the IV drip now.,,,,
,#OCCLPC,1,ALICE,0,The skin looks fine// I guess...,,,,
Peripheral Setup Dialogue - Intro,#PERIIA,1,PETER,1,We will need you to set up a peripheral line for this patient.,,,,
,#PERIIA,2,PETER,1,Before you start// remember to check the patient information. You can do that by clicking on the clipboard at the top.,,,,
,#PERIIA,3,PETER,1,To begin// we need to set up the preparatory items to spike the IV bottle.,,,,
,#PERIIA,4,PETER,1,You can start to prep by removing the foil from the bottle and sterilising with a chlorhexidine wipe.,,,,
Set button blink,#PERIIA,5,PETER,1,Click on the tray to access your items.,,,,
,#PERIHA,1,PETER,1,Click on the Infusion bottle to remove the foil.,,,,
,#PERIHB,1,PETER,1,Drag the chlorhexidine wipe onto the bottle to combine it.,,,,
,#PERIIB,1,PETER,1,Good job! Now that the bottle is prepped// you should prep the IV tubing as well.,,,,
,#PERIIB,2,PETER,1,You can start by clamping the roller clamp. Then// you should remove the protective bag.,,,,
,#PERIIB,3,PETER,1,Once both steps are done// we can now spike the IV bottle.,,,,
,#PERIHC,1,PETER,0,Like I told you just now// you have to clamp the roller clamp.,,,,
,#PERIHC,2,PETER,0,That's the orange thing on the tube.,,,,
,#PERIHD,1,PETER,1,To spike the bag// we need to remove the protective cap.,,,,
,#PERIIC,1,PETER,1,Okay! All the preparatory steps are done// so you can spike the IV bottle now.,,,,
,#PERIHE,1,PETER,0,To spike the bag// we need to drag the IV tubing to the IV bottle to combine them.,,,,
,#PERIFA,1,PETER,0,What are you doing? Why are you unclamping the spike before you have primed it?,,,,
,#PERIFA,1,PETER,0,Please clamp the spike before you continue...,,,,
,#PERIID,1,ALICE,0,Okay! I've spiked the bag// so I am going to hang it on the stand now :D,,,,
Prime,#PERIID,2,PETER,1,Nicely done! We just need to prime the line now.,,,,
,#PERIID,3,PETER,1,If you recall// we need to squeeze the drip chamber and open the roller clamp to prime the line.,,,,
Squeeze Drip Chamber - Fail Case,#PERIHF,1,PETER,1,You should squeeze the drip chamber to prime the line.,,,,
Unclamp Roller Clamp - Fail Case,#PERIHG,1,PETER,1,You should unclamp the roller clamp to prime the IV tubing,,,,
,#PERIIE,1,ALICE,0,There is liquid on the other end of the tube// so it is sufficiently primed.,,,,
,#PERIIE,2,PETER,1,Nicely done! We can start up the BBraun machine now.,,,,
,#PERIFB,1,PETER,1,We should not open the door until we have primed the line// otherwise the alarm will sound if left idle.,,,,
,#PERIHH,1,PETER,1,Press the buttons on the BBraun machine to open the door.,,,,
,#PERIHI,1,PETER,1,Drag the parts of the infusion pump into the machine.,,,,
Add parameters,#PERIII,1,PETER,1,Good job! Now that we have added the infusion tube into the pump// we should input the parameters for the pump.,,,,
,#PERIFC,1,PETER,0,I don't think the parameters are correct...did you input them correctly?,,,,
,#PERIFC,2,PETER,1,Remember to check the patient information carefully.,,,,
,#PERIIJ,1,ALICE,0,Okay! I added all the parameters for the pump.,,,,
,#PERIIJ,2,PETER,1,Good work! Before we can start the pump// however// we need to connect the pump inside the player.,,,,
,#PERIIJ,3,PETER,1,Remember// you need to wipe the clave// then prime the IV plug// and finally add the IV tubing.,,,,
,#PERIHJ,1,PETER,1,Firstly// you need to wipe the clave. It can be accessed in the patient view.,,,,
,#PERIHK,1,PETER,1,You need to flush the IV plug to ensure that there are no air bubbles.,,,,
