Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Closed Roller Clamp,#OCCLRA,1,PETER,1,Oh no! The BBraun infusion pump is emitting an error. Let's go and resolve it :D,,,,
,#OCCLRA,2,PETER,1,To fix the alarm// it is good to check the error message shown on the BBraun Infusion pump.,,,,
,#OCCLRA,3,PETER,1,Remember to mute the alarm// as it can cause distress to the patient.,,,,
,#OCCLRB,1,PETER,1,When the infusion pump shows this error message// it usually means that the roller clamp is closed. Let's go fix that now.,,,,

Prime,#PERIID,2,PETER,1,Nicely done! We just need to prime the line now. ,,,,
,#PERIID,3,PETER,1,If you recall// we need to squeeze the drip chamber and open the roller clamp to prime the line.,,,,
Squeeze Drip Chamber - Fail Case,#PERIHF,1,PETER,1,You should squeeze the drip chamber to prime the line.,,,,
Unclamp Roller Clamp - Fail Case,#PERIHG,1,PETER,1,You should unclamp the roller clamp to prime the IV tubing,,,,
,#PERIIE,1,ALICE,0,There is liquid on the other end of the tube// so it is sufficiently primed.,,,,
,#PERIIE,2,PETER,1,Nicely done! We can start up the B Braun machine now.,,,,
