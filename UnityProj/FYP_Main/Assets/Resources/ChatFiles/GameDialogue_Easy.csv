Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Closed Roller Clamp,#OCCLRA,1,PETER,1,Oh! There's an alarm from the B-Braun pump. Let's have a look!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLRA,2,PETER,1,First// let's check the error message on the infusion pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLRB,1,PETER,1,When the infusion pump shows this error message// it means that the IV fluid is not flowing well into the patient. Let's go fix that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLRB,2,PETER,1,Click on the back button and release the roller clamp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLRC,1,PETER,1,Great! Now that the issue is resolved// let's restart the pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,#OCCLPA,3,ALICE,0,Next// I should put the BBraun machine on standby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPB,1,ALICE,0,The spike site seems very red and swollen. I think phlebitis is present! I clamped the T connector and put the pump on standby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPB,2,PETER,1,Good call! The skin is indeed very red and swollen// indicating the presence of phlebitis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPB,3,PETER,1,Let's stop the IV drip together! To do so// we need to firstly detatch the infusion tube from the plug.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPC,1,ALICE,0,The skin looks fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPE,1,PETER,1,There are many reasons why the [ PRESSURE HIGH ] error is shown// such as a kink in the line// wrong 3 way tap configuration// phlebitis// or a clamped t-connnector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPE,2,PETER,1,In this case// phlebitis is present. The first thing you should do to ensure that phlebitis is present is to go and assess the skin on the skin site.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPF,1,PETER,1,Next// we need to remove the tegaderm and then remove the plug.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPG,1,PETER,1,Good job! Lastly// to aid in recovery// place a plaster on the spot with phlebitis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
