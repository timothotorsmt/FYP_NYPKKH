Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Closed Roller Clamp,#OCCLRA,1,PETER,1,Oh! There's an alarm from the B-Braun pump. Let's have a look!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLRA,2,PETER,1,First// let's check the error message on the infusion pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLRB,1,PETER,1,When the infusion pump shows this error message// it means that the IV fluid is not flowing well into the patient. Let's go fix that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLRB,2,PETER,1,Click on the back button and release the roller clamp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLRC,1,PETER,1,Great! Now that the issue is resolved// let's restart the pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occluision Minigame Dialogue - Pressure high,#OCCLGA,1,PETER,1,When the infusion pump shows this error message// it usually means that something is blocking the flow of the infusion tube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLGA,2,PETER,1,There are many reasons why this could be happening// such as a kink in the line// wrong 3 way tap configuration// phlebitis// or a clamped t-connnector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLGA,3,PETER,1,Let's go and check all of them to find the source of the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,#OCCLGC,1,PETER,1,The alarm is very annoying// can you please deal with it? I'm trying to sleep here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Kinked lines,#OCCLKB,1,PETER,1,There are many reasons why the [ PRESSURE HIGH ] error is shown// such as a kink in the line// wrong 3 way tap configuration// phlebitis// or a clamped t-connnector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLKB,2,PETER,1,"In this case, the lines are kinked. Click on the back button and smoothen the line",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLKA,1,PETER,1,To smoothen out a line// drag the arrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - T Connector,#OCCLTA,1,PETER,1,There are many reasons why the [ PRESSURE HIGH ] error is shown// such as a kink in the line// wrong 3 way tap configuration// phlebitis// or a clamped t-connnector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLTA,2,PETER,1,In this case// it seems that the T-connector is currently clamped// which is causing a pressure build up. Let's unclamp this to resolve the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - 3Way Tap,#OCCL3A,1,PETER,1,It seems that the threeway tap is currently not in the current position// which is causing a pressure buildup. Let's turn this to resolve the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Phlebitis,#OCCLPA,1,ALICE,0,It seems that the skin is very red and swollen. I should stop the pump and inform a senior nurse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPA,2,ALICE,0,Firstly// I think I should remove the T connector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPA,3,ALICE,0,Next// I should put the BBraun machine on standby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPB,1,ALICE,0,The spike site seems very red and swollen. I think phlebitis is present! I clamped the T connector and put the pump on standby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPB,2,PETER,1,Good call! The skin is indeed very red and swollen// indicating the presence of phlebitis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPB,3,PETER,1,Let's stop the IV drip together! To do so// we need to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPC,1,ALICE,0,The skin looks fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPE,1,PETER,0,There are many reasons why the [ PRESSURE HIGH ] error is shown// such as a kink in the line// wrong 3 way tap configuration// phlebitis// or a clamped t-connnector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,#OCCLPE,2,PETER,0,"In this case, phlebitis is present. The first thing you should do to ensure that phlebitis is present is to go and assess the skin on the skin site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
