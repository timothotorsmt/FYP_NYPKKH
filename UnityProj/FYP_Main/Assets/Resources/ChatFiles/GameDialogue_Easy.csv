Occlusion Minigame Dialogue - Closed Roller Clamp,#OCCLRA,1,PETER,1,Oh no! The BBraun infusion pump is emitting an error. Let's go and resolve it :D,,,,
,#OCCLRA,2,PETER,1,To fix the alarm// it is good to check the error message shown on the BBraun Infusion pump.,,,,
,#OCCLRA,3,PETER,1,Remember to mute the alarm// as it can cause distress to the patient.,,,,
,#OCCLRB,1,PETER,1,When the infusion pump shows this error message// it usually means that the roller clamp is closed. Let's go fix that now.,,,,

,#PERIFA,1,PETER,0,Please clamp the spike before you continue...,,,,
,#PERIID,1,ALICE,0,Okay! I've spiked the bag// so I am going to hang it on the stand now :D,,,,
Prime,#PERIID,2,PETER,1,Nicely done! We just need to prime the line now. ,,,,
,#PERIID,3,PETER,1,If you recall// we need to squeeze the drip chamber and open the roller clamp to prime the line.,,,,
Squeeze Drip Chamber - Fail Case,#PERIHF,1,PETER,1,You should squeeze the drip chamber to prime the line.,,,,
Unclamp Roller Clamp - Fail Case,#PERIHG,1,PETER,1,You should unclamp the roller clamp to prime the IV tubing,,,,
,#PERIIE,1,ALICE,0,There is liquid on the other end of the tube// so it is sufficiently primed.,,,,
,#PERIIE,2,PETER,1,Nicely done! We can start up the B Braun machine now.,,,,

,#PERIFC,2,PETER,1,Remember to check the patient information carefully.,,,,
,#PERIIJ,1,ALICE,0,Okay! I added all the parameters for the pump. ,,,,
,#PERIIJ,2,PETER,1,Good work! Before we can start the pump// however// we need to connect the pump inside the player. ,,,,
,#PERIIJ,3,PETER,1,Remember// you need to wipe the clave// then prime the IV plug// and finally add the IV tubing.,,,,
,#PERIHJ,1,PETER,1,Firstly// you need to wipe the clave. It can be accessed in the patient view.,,,,
,#PERIHK,1,PETER,1,You need to flush the IV plug to ensure that there are no air bubbles. ,,,,
